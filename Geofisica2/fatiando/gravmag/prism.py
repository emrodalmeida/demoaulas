r"""
Calculate the potential fields of the 3D right rectangular prism.

.. note:: All input units are SI. Output is in conventional units: SI for the
    gravitatonal potential, mGal for gravity, Eotvos for gravity gradients, nT
    for magnetic total field anomalies.

.. note:: The coordinate system of the input parameters is x -> North,
    y -> East and z -> Down.

**Gravity**

The gravitational fields are calculated using the formula of Nagy et al.
(2000). Available functions are:

* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.potential`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gx`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gy`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gz`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gxx`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gxy`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gxz`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gyy`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gyz`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.gzz`

.. warning::

    The gxy, gxz, and gyz components have singularities when the computation
    point is aligned with the corners of the prism on the bottom, east, and
    north sides, respectively. In these cases, the above functions will move
    the computation point slightly to avoid these singularities. Unfortunately,
    this means that the result will not be as accurate **on those points**.


**Magnetic**

Available fields are the total-field anomaly (using the formula of
Bhattacharyya, 1964) and x, y, z components of the magnetic induction:

* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.tf`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.bx`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.by`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.bz`

**Auxiliary Functions**

Calculates the second derivatives of the function

.. math::

    \phi(x,y,z) = \int\int\int \frac{1}{r}
                  \mathrm{d}\nu \mathrm{d}\eta \mathrm{d}\zeta

with respect to the variables :math:`x`, :math:`y`, and :math:`z`.
In this equation,

.. math::

    r = \sqrt{(x - \nu)^2 + (y - \eta)^2 + (z - \zeta)^2}

and :math:`\nu`, :math:`\eta`, :math:`\zeta` are the Cartesian
coordinates of an element inside the volume of a 3D prism.
These second derivatives are used to calculate
the total field anomaly and the gravity gradient tensor
components.

* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelxx`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelxy`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelxz`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelyy`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelyz`
* :func:`~fatiando.gravmag.prism.kernelzz`
